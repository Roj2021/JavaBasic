Logical Operators:
   Logical Operators allow us to combine multiple conditions.
   work with boolean (true,false) values. There are three logical operators
   1) !, ||, &&

   Why should we use Logical Operators:
    1) The can greatly simplify the logic.
    2) it helps us reduce the lines of code that we have to write.
    NOT(!)
    it reverse the conditions.if something is true it will make it false and if something false it will make true
   System.out.println(!true)=>false
   Logical Or Operators(||):
   it can combine two or more conditions and return true as long as their is on e conditions is true. if all conditions becomes false it returns false
